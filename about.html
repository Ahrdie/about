<em>"Be excellent to each other"</em> is easier said than done, and means different things to different people.
This is a (non-exhaustive) list of behaviours that may lead to deletion of toots, silencing or suspension of accounts, at the descretion of the instance administrators.
In particular, we do not tolerate:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Harrassment, stalking, doxxing</li>
<li>Racism, sexism, verbal abuse or advocation thereof</li>
<li>Discrimination against gender and sexual minorities, or advocation thereof</li>
<li>Violent nationalist propaganda, Nazi symbolism or promoting the ideology of National Socialism</li>
<li>Contacting people who made clear they want no contact. Dogpiling/brigading</li>
<li>Untagged sexual content, gore, or advertisement</li>
<li>Untagged, or automated, or excessive advertisement</li>
<li>Bots interacting with users without their explicit requests</li>
<li>Spamming: If you or your bot need to post with a high frequency, please restrict your posts to your followers to keep the local timeline readable.</li>
<li>We are not a "free speech zone."</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please report behaviour that bothers you.
That includes behaviour from other instances - we have no problem with stopping to federate with asshole instances, or suspend contact with single accounts.

We try to keep the <a href="https://chaos.social/web/timelines/public/local">local timeline</a> of our instance a place of dialogue and interaction.
Therefore we'd like to ask you to keep all <strong>automated posts unlisted</strong>. Unlisted posts can be seen by everybody but do not show up on the local timeline.
This extends to bots, feed posters, Twitter "retweets", and Twitter crossposts with broken mentions.

You can find further information on our instance in our <a href="https://github.com/chaossocial/about">GitHub repository</a>.
We also provide a <a href="https://github.com/chaossocial/about/blob/master/blocked_instances.md">list</a> of currently blocked or silenced instances, alongside with reasons.

<p>
We (<a href="https://chaos.social/@leah">@leah</a> and <a href="https://chaos.social/@rixx">@rixx</a>) are maintaining this instance on our spare time, hardware and nerves.
Don't push either of those.
