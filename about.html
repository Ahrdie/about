<p>Since <em>"Be excellent to each other"</em> is much easier said than done, we have a (non-exhaustive) list of behaviours that may lead to deletion of toots, and silencing or suspension of accounts, if problems persist. In particular, we do not tolerate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Harrassment, stalking, doxxing</li>
<li>Racism, sexism, verbal abuse or advocation thereof</li>
<li>Discrimination against gender and sexual minorities, or advocation thereof</li>
<li>Violent nationalist propaganda, Nazi symbolism or promoting the ideology of National Socialism</li>
<li>Contacting people who made clear they want no contact. Dogpiling/brigading</li>
<li>Untagged sexual content, gore, or advertisement</li>
<li>Untagged, or automated, or excessive advertisement</li>
<li>Bots interacting with users without their explicit requests</li>
</ul>

<p>Please report behaviour that bothers you. That includes behaviour from other instances - we are very willing stop federating with asshole instances.</p>

<p>We (@leah and @rixx) are maintaining this instance on our spare time, hardware and nerves. Don't push either of those.</p>
