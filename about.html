You can find further information on our instance in our <a href="https://github.com/chaossocial/about">GitHub repository</a>, which includes a <a href="https://github.com/chaossocial/about/blob/master/blocked_instances.md">list</a> of currently blocked or silenced instances.

<hr>

We try to keep the <a href="https://chaos.social/web/timelines/public/local">local timeline</a> of our instance a place of dialogue and interaction.
Therefore we'd like to ask you to keep all <strong>automated posts unlisted</strong>. Unlisted posts can be seen by everybody but do not show up on the local timeline.
This extends to bots, feed posters, Twitter "retweets", and Twitter crossposts with broken mentions.

We (<a href="https://chaos.social/@leah">@leah</a> and <a href="https://chaos.social/@rixx">@rixx</a>) are maintaining this instance on our spare time, hardware and nerves.
Don't push either of those.
